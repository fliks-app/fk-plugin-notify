# Development

How to build, test and publish this plugin. What it does for a user is in
[README.md](../README.md); the port from Node is specified in [rust-port.md](rust-port.md); how the
plugin system itself works is in Fliks's `server/docs/spec/plugins.md`.

## Build

The plugin is a Rust WebAssembly component (`pluginApi` 2, target `wasm32-wasip2`) over
`fliks-plugin-sdk`.

```sh
rustup target add wasm32-wasip2
cargo build --release --target wasm32-wasip2   # -> target/wasm32-wasip2/release/fk_plugin_notify.wasm
```

`plugin.template.json` is the manifest without `version` and `files`; the release workflow adds
both. A route, a permission or a settings field is declared there and nowhere else.

## Test

```sh
cargo test --lib
```

The wasm exports of the SDK do not link on a native target, so run `--lib` rather than a bare
`cargo test`. The delivery logic runs against an in-memory `Env`, with no database and no host:
the retry ladder (6 attempts, 1/5/15/30/60 s), the conditional writes, the capacity drop at 200,
the lost sweep and the payloads. The SQL itself is not exercised natively.

## Install it on a dev instance

Build the component, then add `version` and `files` (sha256 of `plugin.wasm` and `logo.svg`) to
`plugin.template.json` to make a `plugin.json`, and zip the three files with a `plugin.json.sig`
or allow unsigned plugins on the dev server (`plugins.allow_unsigned`).

## Publish

Pushing a tag `v<version>` (equal to the crate version) runs `.github/workflows/ci.yml`, which
builds the component, fails above 12 MiB and creates a release with `plugin.json`, `plugin.wasm`
and `logo.svg`. The catalog's `Package plugin` workflow signs those into the `.fkplugin`; see
"WASM plugins" in the catalog README.
